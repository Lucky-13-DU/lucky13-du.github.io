| Abundant          | Nodes are shallowly buried (less than 2 or 3 meters) and relatively common                                        | Small to Large         |
| Normal            | Nodes are commonly found between 5 and 150 meters deep and are relatively large, but only found in certain biomes | Medium to Large        |
| Rare              | Nodes are very deep ( >500 meters), small, quite rare, and hard to find                                           | Small                  |
